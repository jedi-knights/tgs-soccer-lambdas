# ADR 001: Support for Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12

## Context

We need to decide which Python versions to support for our project. The primary consideration is compatibility with AWS Lambda runtimes, as our project is heavily dependent on AWS Lambda functions.

## Decision

We will support the following Python versions:
- Python 3.9
- Python 3.10
- Python 3.11
- Python 3.12

These versions are chosen because they are supported by the AWS Lambda runtime, ensuring that our project can be deployed and run in the AWS Lambda environment without compatibility issues.

## Consequences

- **Pros**:
  - Ensures compatibility with AWS Lambda, which is crucial for our deployment strategy.
  - Focuses our testing and development efforts on a specific set of Python versions, reducing the complexity of our CI/CD pipeline.

- **Cons**:
  - We will not support Python versions below 3.9, which might exclude some users who are still on older versions.
  - We need to ensure that all dependencies are compatible with the chosen Python versions.

## Implementation

We will update our project configuration to specify the supported Python versions and update our CI/CD pipeline to test against these versions. We will also update our documentation to reflect the supported Python versions and provide guidance on how to set up a development environment with the supported versions.
